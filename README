# create-axios-console

A simple open-source template for quickly setting up a **TypeScript** Node.js console application with [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for making HTTP requests.

## Features

- Minimal setup for a console-based Node.js app
- Written in TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- Integrated with Axios for easy HTTP requests
- Ready for customization and extension

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new project using NPX:**
    ```
    npx create-axios-console my-app
    cd my-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the app (no build step required):**
    ```
    npm start
    ```

   > This uses TypeScript directly via `ts-node`.

## Usage

Edit `src/index.ts` to add your own logic and HTTP requests using Axios.
